We have shown that self induced temperature gradients can play a crucial role in Brownian dynamics. Purely from a theoretical stand-point, such a model better explains the flow of energy and entropy through a system. In section ~\autoref{thermodynamics} we explained how the temperature of the environment is a crucial player of the determination of the entropy and energy of the system.
