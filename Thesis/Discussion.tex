We have shown that self induced temperature gradients can play a crucial role in Brownian dynamics. Purely from a theoretical stand-point, such a model better explains the flow of energy and entropy through a system. In section ~\autoref{thermodynamics} we explained how the temperature of the environment is a crucial player of the calculation of the entropy and energy of the system. The fact that our system has a well defined entropy is a strong advantage and allows one to talk about information in a rigorous way. Throughout this thesis, we have purely discussed the properties and the physics of the system, however a rigorous definition of entropy allows one to reason about the properties of the system in terms of it's ability to process information \cite{Landauer1961,MyersCelebranoKrishnan2015}.
