\section{Discussion}
Brownian dynamics is an area of research that is of interest from the perspective of basic physics as well as applied physics. In this thesis, we have discussed Brownian dynamics from a very basic point of view and we have focused on the role of self-induced temperature gradients in the equations of motion.  Purely from a theoretical stand-point, the inclusion of self-induced temperature gradients better explains the flow of energy and entropy throughout a system. In ~\autoref{thermodynamics}, we explained how the temperature of the environment is a crucial player in the calculation of the entropy and energy of a system. The fact that our system has a well defined entropy is a strong advantage and allows one to talk about information in a rigorous way \cite{Landauer1961,MyersCelebranoKrishnan2015}. We derived analytical solutions for the steady state of this system and showed that tilted periodic potentials do not admit a meaningful steady state in one dimension. We found that allowing self induced temperature gradients could have a very complicated effect on the evolution of a system. As the Brownian particle evolves in a potential it causes temperature gradients to occur which affects the future diffusion of the particle, thus creating a rich interaction between the Brownian particle and it's environment.

The dynamical behavior of the Brownian particle was fully described using numerical techniques, these numerical techniques were tested thoroughly using convergence tests and by a comparison to analytical solutions. Using our numerical techniques, we made concrete observations of the reverse Landauer blowtorch effect and Brownian cooling. To the best of our knowledge, these represent the first concrete observations of the reverse Landauer blowtorch effect as arising from a self-consistent theoretical model. In the case of deep wells, self-induced temperature gradients can actually cause the motion of a particle to reduce significantly. This is an unexpected consequence of the reverse Landauer blowtorch effect and leads to some very interesting non-linear behavior. We also saw that self-induced temperature gradients had an effect on the Kramers' rate and we showed that the exact value of the Kramers' rate depends on the properties of the environment.

\section{Future work} \label{outlook}
Our work is valid under certain assumptions, future work could build on our work could build on our results by relaxing these assumptions, here we summarize some generalizations that could be made.

\subsection{Generalization to 2d and 3d systems}
Many systems of interest are multi-dimensional and cannot be approximated by a one-dimensional system \cite{KellerBustamante2000,Magnasco1994,Reimann2001,ChallisJack2014,M.W.Jack2016}. In particular, finding the efficiency of a molecular motor involves calculating the flow of energy from one degree of freedom to another \cite{M.W.Jack2016}. Furthermore, generalizing our system to more dimensions gives more directions in which heat can flow, therefore allowing us to conserve energy in a more general sense. The equations motion in multiple dimensions can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}, \, t) &=& - (P(\mathbf{x}, \, t) \nabla V(x) + k_B T(\mathbf{x}, \, t) \nabla P(\mathbf{x}, t)), \\
\frac{\partial P(\mathbf{x}, \, t)}{\partial t} &=& -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J(\mathbf{x}, \, t)}, \\
\text{and} \nonumber \\
\frac{\partial T(\mathbf{x}, \, t)}{\partial t} &=& -\kappa \mathbf{J(\mathbf{x}, \, t)} \cdot \nabla V(\mathbf{x}, \, t) + D \nabla^2 T(\mathbf{x}, \, t).
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Inter-particle interactions}
Inter-particle interactions play a very important role in Brownian dynaimcs \cite{leibler1990physical,Leibler1993}, an example of this is the myosin protein in cells which is used in the contraction of muscles \cite{TyskaWarshaw2002}. Individually, myosin proteins are poor at carrying loads when compared to their kinesin couterparts \cite{TyskaWarshaw2002}, however their collective actions are very powerful due to the rich nature of their inter-motor interactions.

The set of equations that we have been using do not apply to more than one Brownian particle without some considerable changes. This is due to very complicated inter-particle interactions that can occur when considering thermal fluctautions of the kind that we are focusing on. To visualize this intuitively, imagine two particles diffusing in their reaction coordinates, both subject to the same potential. Particle one may induce local temperature gradients that will affect particle two if particle two moves to where particle one created those temperature gradients. These interactions involve second-order statistics that are beyond the scope of this project.

\subsection{Fluid dynamics} \label{fluidDynamics}
The Brownian particles that we have been modelling have been suspended in a fluid. The dynamics of fluids present a formidable and exciting challenge to both physicists and mathematicians alike. As well as this there has been effort in the literature to combine the Smoluchowski equation with the Navier-Stokes equation, thus linking the world of Brownian dynamics with fluid dynamics \cite{Constantin2007}. The two physical phenomena that we neglect which could be treated with techniques from fluid dynamics are compressible fluids and heat convection through fluid flow. Despite the fact that we neglected these phenomena, our system is still physical and is self-consistent.

In \autoref{thermodynamics}, in order to gain insight on the entropy we had to assume that we were dealing with an incompressible fluid. Without this assumption, we would not be able to guarantee that our equations of motion
increase the entropy. Therefore, in order to obey the laws of thermodynamics in a compressible fluid, we would have to include extra terms in our equations of motion.

The second important phenomena that can be described by fluid dynamics is fluid flow. This phenomenon is responsible for heat transport via convection, currently we only consider heat flow via diffusion, this means that we are tacitly assuming that the fluid in which our Brownian particle is suspended, is stationary. Including convection into our model would involve modifying the heat equation (equation \ref{eqn:TemperatureEvolution}) so that it reads

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + u(x) \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = -\kappa J \partial_x V + D \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} 
\end{equation}
Where $u(x)$ represents the flow of the fluid, one can imagine that such a flow would have an effect on the system by transporting the temperature gradients with the flow of the fluid. The next step in including fluid dynamics into the system would be to introduce the Navier-Stokes equations into our system, thus yielding three coupled equations to solve.

\subsection{Information theory and computation with Brownian particles}
The link between statistical mechanics and information theory has been established by Landauer \cite{Landauer1961}. In this paper Landauer considers bi-stable potentials similar to those discussed in ~\autoref{Kramers}. He then uses statistical mechanics to show that the erasure of information is associated with a generation of entropy, this therefore puts a theoretical lower bound on the amount of heat that a computer must produce in order to operate. Ref \cite{MyersCelebranoKrishnan2015} gives an experimental realization of information storage and retrieval using a levitating colloidal particle. Our model considers the flow of heat and its effect on the environment explicitly, therefore an obvious future project would be to reconsider Landauer's logic in the case of self-induced temperature gradients. By considering the effect that the Brownian particle has on the environment, one could possibly gain some considerable insight into the role of statistical mechanics in computation.

%is particularly interesting in Brownian motors, where the effect could lead to a stall in the motor. We speculate that biological systems will have mechanisms in place to avoid these stalls because a motor stall would mean that the motor would no longer be able to perform it's designated task.

%The courageous reader may want to use our model in the case of a compressible fluid, however in this case we can no longer guarantee that entropy will increase.
