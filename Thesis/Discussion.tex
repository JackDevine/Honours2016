We have shown that self induced temperature gradients can play a crucial role in Brownian dynamics. Purely from a theoretical stand-point, such a model better explains the flow of energy and entropy through a system. In ~\autoref{thermodynamics} we explained how the temperature of the environment is a crucial player in the calculation of the entropy and energy of the system. The fact that our system has a well defined entropy is a strong advantage and allows one to talk about information in a rigorous way \cite{Landauer1961,MyersCelebranoKrishnan2015}.
