  abstract = {The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Smoluchowski equation are investigated for the case of potentials withN deep wells. The small parameter $\delta$=kT/V, which measures the ratio of the thermal energy to a typical well depth, is used in connection with the method of matched asymptotic expansion to obtained asymptotic approximations to all the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. It is found that the eigensolutions fall into two classes, namely (i) the top-of-the-well and (ii) the bottom-of-the-well eigensolutions. The eigenvalues for both classes of solutions are integer multiples of the squqres of the frequencies at the top or bottom of the various wells. The eigenfunctions are, in general, localized to the top or bottom of the corresponding well. The very small eigenvalues require special consideration because the asymptotic analysis is incapable of distinguishing them from the zero eigenvalue with multiplicityN. Another approximation reveals that, in addition to the true zero eigenvalue, there areN-1 eigenvalues of order exp(−$\delta$). The case of other possible multiple eigenvalues is also examined.},

for almost any industrial process. The original description
of classical heat engines by Sadi Carnot in 1824 has largely
shaped our understanding of work and heat exchange during
macroscopic thermodynamic processes1. Equipped with our
present-day ability to design and control mechanical devices at
micro- and nanometre length scales, we are now in a position
to explore the limitations of classical thermodynamics, arising
on scales for which thermal fluctuations are important2–5. Here
we demonstrate the experimental realization of a microscopic
heat engine, comprising a single colloidal particle subject to a
time-dependent optical laser trap. The work associated with
the system is a fluctuating quantity, and depends strongly
on the cycle duration time, , which in turn determines the
efficiency of our heat engine. Our experiments offer a rare
insight into the conversion of thermal to mechanical energy on
a microscopic level, and pave the way for the design of future
micromechanical machines.},

  journal =  {Nature},
  year =     {1990},
  abstract = {Kinesin, a mechanoenzyme that couples ATP hydrolysis to movement along microtubules, is thought to power vesicle transport and other forms of microtubule-based motility. Here, microscopic silica beads were precoated with carrier protein, exposed to low concentrations of kinesin, and individually manipulated with a single-beam gradient-force optical particle trap ('optical tweezers') directly onto microtubules. Optical tweezers greatly improved the efficiency of the bead assay, particularly at the lowest kinesin concentrations (corresponding to approximately 1 molecule per bead). Beads incubated with excess kinesin moved smoothly along a microtubule for many micrometres, but beads carrying from 0.17-3 kinesin molecules per bead, moved, on average, only about 1.4 microns and then spontaneously released from the microtubule. Application of the optical trap directly behind such moving beads often pulled them off the microtubule and back into the centre of the trap. This did not occur when a bead was bound by an AMP.PNP-induced rigor linkage, or when beads were propelled by several kinesin molecules. Our results are consistent with a model in which kinesin detaches briefly from the microtubule during a part of each mechanochemical cycle, rather than a model in which kinesin remains bound at all times.}

can generate mechanical motion and force. In the simplest case the fluctuating movements of a motor enzyme are well
described by a diffusion process on a two-dimensional potential energy surface, where one dimension is a chemical reaction
coordinate and the other is the spatial displacement of the motor. The coupling between chemistry and motion results from
the shape of the surface, and motor velocities and forces result from diffusion currents on this surface. This microscopic
description is shown to possess an equivalent kinetic mechanism in which the rate constants depend on externally applied
forces. By using this equivalence we explore the characteristic properties of several broad classes of motor mechanisms and
give general expressions for motor velocity versus load force for any member of each class. We show that in some cases
simple plots of 1/velocity vs. 1/concentration can distinguish between classes of motor mechanisms and may be used to
determine the step at which movement occurs.},

  abstract = {We have proposed a model to analyze the growth kinetics of lysozyme crystals/aggregates under non-isothermal conditions. The model was formulated through an analysis of the entropy production of the growth process which was obtained by taking into account the explicit dependence of the free energy on the temperature. We found that the growth process is coupled with temperature variations, resulting in a novel Soret-type effect. We identified the surface entropy of the crystal/aggregate as a decisive ingredient controlling the behavior of the average growth rate as a function of temperature. The behavior of the Gibbs free energy as a function of temperature is also analyzed. The agreement between theory and experiments is very good in the range of temperatures considered.},

  abstract = {We consider a large number of particles on a one-dimensional lattice 1Z in
interaction with a heat particle; the latter is located on the bond linking the
position of the particle to the point to which it jumps. The energy of a single
particle is given by a potential V(x), x 9 Z. In the continuum limit, the classical
version leads to Brownian motion with drift. A quantum version leads to a local
drift velocity which is independent of the applied force. Both these models obey
Einstein's relation between drift, diffusion, and applied force. The system obeys
the first and second laws of thermodynamics, with the time evolution given by
a pair of coupled non linear heat equations, one for the density of the Brownian
particles and one for the heat occupation number; the equation for a tagged
Brownian particle can be written as a stochastic differential equation.},

  abstract = {Type IVa pili are filamentous cell surface structures observed in many bacteria. They pull cells forward by extending, adhering to surfaces, and then retracting. We used cryo–electron tomography of intact Myxococcus xanthus cells to visualize type IVa pili and the protein machine that assembles and retracts them (the type IVa pilus machine, or T4PM) in situ, in both the piliated and nonpiliated states, at a resolution of 3 to
4 nanometers. We found that T4PM comprises an outer membrane pore, four interconnected ring structures in the periplasm and cytoplasm, a cytoplasmic disc and dome, and a periplasmic stem. By systematically imaging mutants lacking defined T4PM proteins or
with individual proteins fused to tags, we mapped the locations of all 10 T4PM core components and the minor pilins, thereby providing insights into pilus assembly, structure, and function.},
