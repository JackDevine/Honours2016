  abstract = {The conversion of energy into mechanical work is essential
for almost any industrial process. The original description
of classical heat engines by Sadi Carnot in 1824 has largely
shaped our understanding of work and heat exchange during
macroscopic thermodynamic processes1. Equipped with our
present-day ability to design and control mechanical devices at
micro- and nanometre length scales, we are now in a position
to explore the limitations of classical thermodynamics, arising
on scales for which thermal fluctuations are important2–5. Here
we demonstrate the experimental realization of a microscopic
heat engine, comprising a single colloidal particle subject to a
time-dependent optical laser trap. The work associated with
the system is a fluctuating quantity, and depends strongly
on the cycle duration time, , which in turn determines the
efficiency of our heat engine. Our experiments offer a rare
insight into the conversion of thermal to mechanical energy on
a microscopic level, and pave the way for the design of future
micromechanical machines.},

  journal =  {Nature},
  year =     {1990},
  abstract = {Kinesin, a mechanoenzyme that couples ATP hydrolysis to movement along microtubules, is thought to power vesicle transport and other forms of microtubule-based motility. Here, microscopic silica beads were precoated with carrier protein, exposed to low concentrations of kinesin, and individually manipulated with a single-beam gradient-force optical particle trap ('optical tweezers') directly onto microtubules. Optical tweezers greatly improved the efficiency of the bead assay, particularly at the lowest kinesin concentrations (corresponding to approximately 1 molecule per bead). Beads incubated with excess kinesin moved smoothly along a microtubule for many micrometres, but beads carrying from 0.17-3 kinesin molecules per bead, moved, on average, only about 1.4 microns and then spontaneously released from the microtubule. Application of the optical trap directly behind such moving beads often pulled them off the microtubule and back into the centre of the trap. This did not occur when a bead was bound by an AMP.PNP-induced rigor linkage, or when beads were propelled by several kinesin molecules. Our results are consistent with a model in which kinesin detaches briefly from the microtubule during a part of each mechanochemical cycle, rather than a model in which kinesin remains bound at all times.}

can generate mechanical motion and force. In the simplest case the fluctuating movements of a motor enzyme are well
described by a diffusion process on a two-dimensional potential energy surface, where one dimension is a chemical reaction
coordinate and the other is the spatial displacement of the motor. The coupling between chemistry and motion results from
the shape of the surface, and motor velocities and forces result from diffusion currents on this surface. This microscopic
description is shown to possess an equivalent kinetic mechanism in which the rate constants depend on externally applied
forces. By using this equivalence we explore the characteristic properties of several broad classes of motor mechanisms and
give general expressions for motor velocity versus load force for any member of each class. We show that in some cases
simple plots of 1/velocity vs. 1/concentration can distinguish between classes of motor mechanisms and may be used to
determine the step at which movement occurs.},
