First I would like to Acknowledge my supervisor Dr. Michael Jack for helping me through this difficult project and always being available to give me advice. As well as this I would like to acknowledge Professor Michael Colombo, Vaughan Weatherall and Loren Kersey for reading very early drafts of this report, they helped me to remove many mistakes. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues in the honors room for their camaraderie and banter throughout the year.
