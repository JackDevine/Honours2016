Here we will show some results of finite differencing and of the stochastic methods. Figure~\ref{fig:FiniteDifferences} shows a simulation of a particle density for a certain amount of time. In this figure we see that the density tends to accumulate into the wells and that wherever the density has a sharp peak, it will interact with the environment thermally. The strength of these thermal interactions depends on $\kappa$ and for a non vanishing $D$ they tend to diffuse away into a smoother shape. If we allow these simulations to run for long enough, then eventually we will reach the predicted steady state.

Meanwhile, figure \ref{fig:Stochastic} shows a similar situation that has been simulated stochastically. In this case, we  are able to deal with a temperature that is non constant in space, however we are not able to quantify the particles interaction with the environment. This means that $\kappa$ vanishes in our stochastic model. In the future, we aim to be able to deal with these thermal interactions by using the microscopic equations given by Streater \cite{Streater1997, Streater1997a}.
