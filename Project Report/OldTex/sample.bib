  abstract = {Transport phenomena in spatially periodic systems far from thermal equilibrium are
considered. The main emphasize is put on directed transport in so-called Brownian
motors (ratchets), i.e. a dissipative dynamics in the presence of thermal noise and
some prototypical perturbation that drives the system out of equilibrium without introducing
a priori an obvious bias into one or the other direction of motion. Symmetry
conditions for the appearance (or not) of directed current, its inversion upon variation
of certain parameters, and quantitative theoretical predictions for specific models
are reviewed as well as a wide variety of experimental realizations and biological applications,
especially the modeling of molecular motors. Extensions include quantum
mechanical and collective effects, Hamiltonian ratchets, the influence of spatial disorder,
and diffusive transport.},
