  review =   {In this paper the authors create a molecular motor by using a time dependant laser trap as the potential for the motor. I am unable to easily infer the free energy landscape, so it would be hard to compare this with my model. In this paper the size of the colloidal particle (a melamime bead) is 2.94 micro meters.}
