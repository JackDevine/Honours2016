  abstract = {The conversion of energy into mechanical work is essential
for almost any industrial process. The original description
of classical heat engines by Sadi Carnot in 1824 has largely
shaped our understanding of work and heat exchange during
macroscopic thermodynamic processes1. Equipped with our
present-day ability to design and control mechanical devices at
micro- and nanometre length scales, we are now in a position
to explore the limitations of classical thermodynamics, arising
on scales for which thermal fluctuations are important2–5. Here
we demonstrate the experimental realization of a microscopic
heat engine, comprising a single colloidal particle subject to a
time-dependent optical laser trap. The work associated with
the system is a fluctuating quantity, and depends strongly
on the cycle duration time, , which in turn determines the
efficiency of our heat engine. Our experiments offer a rare
insight into the conversion of thermal to mechanical energy on
a microscopic level, and pave the way for the design of future
micromechanical machines.},

  title =    {The Mechanochemistry of Molecular Motors},
  journal =  {Biophysical Journal},
  year =     {2000},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT A theory of molecular motors is presented that explains how the energy released in single chemical reactions
can generate mechanical motion and force. In the simplest case the fluctuating movements of a motor enzyme are well
described by a diffusion process on a two-dimensional potential energy surface, where one dimension is a chemical reaction
coordinate and the other is the spatial displacement of the motor. The coupling between chemistry and motion results from
the shape of the surface, and motor velocities and forces result from diffusion currents on this surface. This microscopic
description is shown to possess an equivalent kinetic mechanism in which the rate constants depend on externally applied
forces. By using this equivalence we explore the characteristic properties of several broad classes of motor mechanisms and
give general expressions for motor velocity versus load force for any member of each class. We show that in some cases
simple plots of 1/velocity vs. 1/concentration can distinguish between classes of motor mechanisms and may be used to
determine the step at which movement occurs.},

between reservoirs or from external thermodynamic forces. These systems can operate in a variety of modes,
including as isothermal engines, heat engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps. We derive analytical results showing
that certain classes of multidimensional Brownian motor, including the Smoluchowski-Feynman ratchet, are
unable to attain perfect efficiency (Carnot efficiency for heat engines). This demonstrates the presence of intrinsic
irreversibilities in their operating mechanism. We present numerical simulations showing that in some cases the
loss process that limits efficiency is associated with vortices in the probability current},

  title =    {A microscopic steam engine implemented in an optical tweezer},
  journal =  {Nature Communications},
  year =     {2014},
  abstract = {The introduction of improved steam engines at the end of the 18th century marked the start
of the industrial revolution and the birth of classical thermodynamics. Currently, there is great
interest in miniaturizing heat engines, but so far traditional heat engines operating with the
expansion and compression of gas have not reached length scales shorter than one millimeter.
Here, a micrometer-sized piston steam engine is implemented in an optical tweezer.
The piston is a single colloidal microparticle that is driven by explosive vapourization of the
surrounding liquid (cavitation bubbles) and by optical forces at a rate between a few tens of
Hertz and one kilo-Hertz. The operation of the engine allows to exert impulsive forces with
optical tweezers and induce streaming in the liquid, similar to the effect of transducers when
driven at acoustic and ultrasound frequencies.},

considered. The main emphasize is put on directed transport in so-called Brownian
motors (ratchets), i.e. a dissipative dynamics in the presence of thermal noise and
some prototypical perturbation that drives the system out of equilibrium without introducing
a priori an obvious bias into one or the other direction of motion. Symmetry
conditions for the appearance (or not) of directed current, its inversion upon variation
of certain parameters, and quantitative theoretical predictions for specific models
are reviewed as well as a wide variety of experimental realizations and biological applications,
especially the modeling of molecular motors. Extensions include quantum
mechanical and collective effects, Hamiltonian ratchets, the influence of spatial disorder,
and diffusive transport.},
